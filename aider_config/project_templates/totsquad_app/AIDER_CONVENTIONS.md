# Functional Description of TotSquad the Company

About

Tot Squad is a marketplace that aggregates the fragmented baby service industry and enables booking via real-time availability and reviews. Similar to Honeyfund for weddings, new and expecting parents can now add services like lactation consulting, sleep coaching, and more to their baby registries at major retailers like Amazon and Target.

Thesis

Expanding Market:  The $12B baby services industry is growing as parents seek services like car seat installation, feeding support, night nannies, and prenatal massage.

Current Challenges:   Parents rely on informal networks to find these fragmented services, complicating the process for those used to easy online shopping and registry additions.

Tot Squad’s Advantage:  Tot Squad, partnered with major retailers like Target and Amazon (where 80%+ of parents create registries), offers a unique first-to-market solution akin to Honeyfund in the wedding industry.

Highlights

Experienced team led by baby-industry insiders including serial entrepreneur, CEO  Jen Saxton  and recent addition  Lindsay Cosgrove  who grew Snoo from $5M to $70M as VP of Marketing

Tot Squad just launched on Target and Amazon and has already seen the number of registry-adds double 4x; "MotherFund" product launching soon
