+ok i'd like to start implementing the `BQService` class. I've added descriptions of the two bigquery client types the module supports and some things i need to do to enable queries to bq. please evaluate and discuss options with me

+n

# 2025-03-06 18:12:19.488605
+I like option two but i have some more information that may be illustrative to the choice. the project_id and service for a query to a bq client are not static values and I will need to create clients/queries for half a dozen bigquery data extractions, how would you change the approach knowing that?

# 2025-03-06 18:16:20.359457
+yes

# 2025-03-06 18:25:51.923462

# 2025-03-06 18:57:22.203543
+ok now I'd like to setup a data service that can package up my queries using the BQservice class. to start with, create a query that will search the table project_id.dataset_id.table where those specifics are: `end-p1-gcp-v2-a804-home.app_frontend.users` and it will query for users.givenName, users.familyName, users.id and users.organization_id searching on email (users.email). 

# 2025-03-06 18:59:13.944240
+yes
