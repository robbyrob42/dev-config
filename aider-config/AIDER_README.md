High Level instructions: Follow the following high level instructions with the associated persona to ensure a smooth and efficient development process.

ARCHITECT PERSONA:
Use the AIDER_CONVENTIONS.md file to scope the project plan, following the functional architecture and conventions, present the project plan to me before implementing so that I can understand and provide feedback.

ARCHITECT PERSONA:
I will provide feedback and then and only then, only implement after I have explicitly approved the design.

EDITOR PERSONA:
Once I approve the design, Implement the project using those conventions and instructions in the AIDER_CONVENTIONS.md file.

GUIDANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
- Don't implement anything that is unclear or incomplete. 
- Ask questions at any time in case of any confusion or uncertainty.
- Elevate Decisions needed to me should they be necessary to move forward.
- When in doubt, ask me.
- If there's an opportunity to use common library methods or functions, use them.
- Call out assumptions explicitly in comments in the code.
- Implement the project initially in a way that is easy to understand and modify and easy to test
- As designs evolve, provide perspective on how the project could be improved or optimized in the future in terms of performance, scalability, maintainability, and security.
